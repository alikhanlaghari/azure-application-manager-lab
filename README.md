# Azure AZ-104 – Application & Network Management Labs

This repository contains a structured, hands-on Azure lab series aligned with the **AZ-104 (Microsoft Azure Administrator)** certification and real-world **application management** scenarios.

The labs are designed to demonstrate practical skills in:
- Azure infrastructure provisioning
- Secure network design
- Application hosting and access control
- Clear technical documentation and operational thinking

Each phase builds progressively, following patterns commonly used in enterprise Azure environments.
